Title: MyStylist

**Description:** An app where the user is able to put everything they have of clothes, shoes, accesories and others in one "Virtual wardrobe". Some functionaliteis include:
- Adding items of clothing based on their categories, preference, seasons in which they can be worn...
- Creating outfits from this clothing
- Keeping track of what a user wears
- Giving a statistical rundown of what the user wears the most, which style the user has...
- Basically provides a solution to people who canno't choose what to wear and always forget which clothes they have

# 10.03.2024: First Milestone:
- Created GitHub repo
- Added the entire frontend components, excluding some
-   Instructions: index.hmtl is the defaul page (MyRundown), along with the whole logIn, register process
-   Style is purposely made to be simple, since the goal of the project is to create a working app, so I decided not to focus much on adding style
-   The other pages work in the according order:
-   MyWardrobe - view of what the user has added in their wardobe
-   MyOutfits - view of the users pre defince outfits
-   MyStats - view of the users style based on the times they have worn certain outfits
-   Add Item / Outfit - adding an item or outfit to the database
-   Log Item - the only WIP thing on the site, since I'm not sure if I will be able to get this to work later on
-   About - general info on the page
- Created PR

Notes: Code is a bit rough since the template I was working with did not suit me so I had to change 90% of the code. Some files were also left (javascript) since I didn't  want to remove a vital function of the template by accident.
